Title: Weather Scene Generator
## Description
I am thinking of creating a generator which allows users to change weathers, scenes, and the time of the day, and display as a pixel image with the selected variables. There will be three drag down menus, so users can change their selections and the image will change according to the updated selections as they click Confirm. Elements of infinite variations will include scenes, time of day, and weathers.
## Main Structure
base.js - controlling the main structures including the declaration of all elements
options.js - containing all options (including scenes, times, weathers)
scene-and-time.js - Rendering the main look of the canvas (the scene and the time)
weather.js - containing all weather subclasses, so they will be ready to call in the base.js
